# Raymond Yu's Portfolio Website

Welcome! This repository showcases my web development skills and creative vision through a personal portfolio website. It's inspired by smoljames's work and tailored to reflect my experience.

###This site highlights three of my key projects:

- Ryse Performance Training Website: A dynamic website promoting my training services.
- Marketplace Project (Python & Django): A demonstration of my back-end development capabilities using Python's Django framework.
- Ryse Sports Training Business: Information about my sports training business, Ryse.

### This portfolio leverages various technologies to deliver a compelling user experience:

- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-end:** Python, Django, Node.js
